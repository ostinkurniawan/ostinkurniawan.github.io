    <h4 class="section-header">THE PROBLEM</h4>
    <div class="project-text">After surgery, patients are often given a generous prescription for powerful yet addictive <strong>opioid-based analgesics</strong> (painkillers). Unlike the experience in a controlled hospital environment, at home, patients are suddenly faced with the need to regulate their own pain medication while they recover. The combination of over-prescription [1], ineffective self-regulation [2], and a lack of awareness of drug return practices [2] has resulted in an opioid crisis that has claimed more than 42,000 deaths and two million cases of opioid abuse in 2016 alone1. </div>
    <h4 class="section-header">DESIGN QUESTION</h4>
    <div class="project-text"><strong>How can we support and improve mindful and data-informed post-operative pain management to maximise patient comfort while deterring medication abuse? </strong></div>

    </div>
    <div class="project-text">In order to address the problem effectively, an understanding of the underlying problems was needed. In order to do this, the team first conducted preliminary research into the causes of the opioid epidemic. This was done by speaking with the professional medical stakeholders, online research, and preliminary analysis of academic research in this space. <br>Through this research, a basic context was established around the issues, the environmental factors, the limitations that medical professionals and patients face, prescription practices, and usability baselines within this specific market sector. <br>‍<br>This research resulted in a number of findings: </div>

    <div class="project-text">Through this research, we came up with our proposed high-level solution: <strong>an easy-to-use, secure, and robust self medication device, which could gently step users down towards lower or less frequent doses of medication and provide caregivers with the resultant data. </strong></div>

    <h4 class="heading"><strong class="section-header">LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></h4>
    <div class="project-text">A literature review on a total of nine background papers was conducted to acquire a deeper understanding of the problem space. The review focused on the history of the problem space and PCA in hospital settings, safety, patient perspectives, opioid storage patterns, and the opioid crisis in the United States. This research was important in providing robust basal knowledge in order to understand the problem, its implications, and existing interaction design conventions. <br><br>Some key quotes:</div>
    <ul class="project-content-list">
      <li>
        <div class="list-item">“In the open-ended response portion of the survey, patients commented on this ambiguity with the following comments: “anxious on whether or not to hit the button,” “left in the dark,” “making the pain worse,” and “always in pain because I never knew if I was actually getting any medicine.” The ambiguity around pain medication delivery and the denied attempts during the lockout period may contribute to patients’ perceptions that the PCA is an unreliable pain treatment modality.”<br>- Patak et al., 2014</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="list-item">“During the pilot, there were no medication incidents, medication loss, or diversion. There were no incidents of serious adverse events such as respiratory depression or somnolence. Twenty-two of the 24 patients (92%) were satisfied or very satisfied with the program when interviewed by a Pain Team member.”<br>- Kastanias et al., 2006</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="list-item">“In summary, the Abbott PCA Plus II interface does not conform with existing human factors guidelines, thereby unnecessarily increasing both the demands on users and the probability of human errors. The design deficiencies that were identified are summarised in Table 1, along with the effects of each problem, its severity, and a proposed solution.”<br>- Lin et al., 1998</div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="heading"><strong class="section-header">INTERVIEWS</strong></h4>
    <div class="project-text">We conducted semi-structured interviews with seven individuals, all of whom have had were given opioids after a surgery, with ages ranging from 21 to 82 and representing a wide variety of backgrounds including students, medical professionals, and schoolteachers. We chose to use the semi-structured interview format as it allowed for the exploration of new ideas and questions that arise during the interview, while still being structured by a framework of central themes. </div>
    <h4 class="heading"><strong class="section-header">COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</strong></h4>
    <div class="project-text">Wo conducted a competitive analysis of twelve existing pill adherence, reminder systems, and dispensing products on the market was conducted to identify existing modalities, features, storage methods, and scenarios where these devices could be used. <br><br>From the competitive analysis, it was found that many at-home devices on the market primary serve one purpose: pill adherence, especially for multi-pill situations such as morning vitamins and medication. Most devices were also meant for long-term use. Contrastingly, the use-case for Recap PCA would be short-term management of controlled substances, none of which the competitors addressed. </div>

    <h4 class="heading"><strong class="section-header">FORM FACTOR</strong></h4>
    <div class="project-text">While it is understood that overall form factor may be dependent on the size, shape, and orientation of the dispensing mechanism, ideation on form factor was not initially limited by these constraints. With the exception of design requirements, ideation was largely unconstrained, supported by a free-flowing dynamic of design sprints. Team members sketched ideas and then discussed and iterated upon them based on team feedback. Going back to the drawing board after each sprint was supported by this team input, especially when suggestions for how to stretch a good idea further were given. Early form-factor concepts agreed upon as a team were prototyped. </div>

    <h4 class="heading"><strong class="section-header">USER FLOW AND INTERFACE DESIGN</strong></h4>
    <div class="project-text">The user flow was drafted based on the foundation of a numeric pain scale (NPS) from 0 to 3 for use with the device. With basic features and functionality detailed in the set of design requirements, an interaction flow was needed to tie together device functionalities with user interaction (screen, software, physical interaction) and how they may interact with the structured medical regimen facilitated by the device. <br><br>Interface design broke down high-level user-facing components of the user flow into what would become screens and buttons for machine prompts, responses, and feedback for the user. <br>The user prompts are an important aspect of the user interface that we wanted to begin working on to obtain as much feedback as possible early in the process. Clear wording in the interface will be just as important for preventing user confusion as a clear user flow. Understandable phrasing will allow users who are unfamiliar with the device to feel confident in its use. <br>‍</div>

    <div class="project-text">Collecting data on users of any device or service is not a benign action. Data may be stolen or abused with little regard for its impact on others. As a result, our team has carefully considered the role data collection plays in this device. Currently, opioid prescribing practices are based largely upon guesswork. Data collection in aggregate form can potentially play an important role in providing researchers and caregivers numeric data for prescription use, patterns, and behaviours. In light of this, we have determined that collecting such analytics as a device feature is worthwhile and aligns with both patient and caregiver values.<br> </div>

    <h4 class="heading"><strong class="section-header">ITERATION &amp; USER INTERFACe</strong></h4>
    <div class="project-text">As the basis for our interface design, the user flow was revised. One problem that was identified when sample use-cases were run through the interface was that clarity regarding the way the device made the distinction between over-the-counter drugs (adjuncts for opioids) and opioids was a little too simplistic. The initial user flow outlined previously did not allow for error recovery or for full patient autonomy to choose a specific dose they wanted, a decision that was felt to be potentially conductive to user hostility against the device or feelings of “controlling”. In order to improve upon this, a “other options” selection was added to give the users more autonomy. <br><br>After the user flow diagram was fleshed out, a prototype of the interface based on the user flow was developed. This prototype was developed in Figma, an online visual prototyping software suite. By creating it in this way, we were able to adjust the emulated layout as needed without having to re-create everything physically when changes were desired. This prototype was also conductive to purely testing the user flow without the influence of other factors like a bona fide physical interface. In this way, our design decisions relating to the user flow could be evaluated and validated.  </div>
