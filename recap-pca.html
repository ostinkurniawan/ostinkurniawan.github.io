        <div class="project-body">After surgery, patients in a hospital setting are closely monitored and often given powerful opioid-based analgesics (painkillers). In some cases, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) devices are used, allowing for pain management that is more tailored to the patient&#x27;s specific experience, but are notably still monitored by healthcare professionals. <br><br>However, when patients move back home, they are often given a generous prescription for powerful yet addictive opioid-based analgesics (painkillers). Unlike the experience in a controlled hospital environment, patients are suddenly faced with the need to regulate their own pain medication while they recover. The combination of over-prescription, ineffective self-regulation, and a lack of awareness of drug return practices has contributed to an opioid crisis that has claimed more than 42,000 deaths and two million cases of opioid abuse in 2016 alone.<br><br>This project is an investigation into bringing the concept of patient-controlled analgesia into the home.

        <div class="project-body">We conducted a competitive analysis of twelve existing pill adherence, reminder systems, and dispensing products on the market to identify existing modalities, features, storage methods, and scenarios where these devices could be used. We found that many at-home devices on the market primarily serve one purpose: long-term, static-schedule pill adherence, especially for multi-pill situations such as morning vitamins and medication. <br><br>Contrastingly, the use-case for Recap PCA would be short-term management of controlled substances, none of which the competitors addressed.</div>

        <div class="project-body">Collecting data on users of any device or service is not a benign action. Data may be stolen or abused with little regard for its impact on others. As a result, our team has carefully considered the role data collection plays in this device. Currently, opioid prescribing practices are based largely upon guesswork. Data collection in aggregate form can potentially play an important role in providing researchers and caregivers numeric data for prescription use, patterns, and behaviours. In light of this, we have determined that collecting such analytics as a device feature is worthwhile and aligns with both patient and caregiver values.<br></div>

Since the product was intended to be set up in a prominent area of a patient&#x27;s home so they would be able to see the alerts on the UI, ensuring that the physical design was visually appealing enough that it was not simply hidden away in some corner (defeating the purpose of alerts) was integral.

          <div class="project-body">Reworked the physical panel where the screen is located to have a 45° angle to the base to allow for use from all directions. Screen at a more aggressive angle (e.g. 90°) was not ideal due to lateral movement of the device and needing to stoop down if device is located in a low position. <br></div>
          <div class="project-body">Pill dispensing area (the &#x27;mouth&#x27;) was too flat, requiring a user to hunt around for the pill in the dispensing area. <br></div>

          <p class="image-caption">We have both &quot;soft&quot; lockouts and &quot;hard/full&quot; lockouts. Hard lockouts are exclusively reserved for scenarios where it is physically unsafe to take another opioid. &quot;Soft&quot; lockouts can always be overridden in the case where a patient is in pain and does require more medication. <br></p>

        <div class="project-body">In reflection, more user testing, especially with the finalised user interface, could have been conducted to ensure that the revised interface was less conducive to mistakes, could facilitate increased error recovery, increase clarity, and validate the idea that the touch screen was a better choice over physical buttons. With this testing, parts of the user flow could be further improved or validated, including aspects of content designs, decision trees, and button placement. <br><br>In terms of expanding the current functionality of the device, there are also a number of things to be addressed. Feasibility, device ownership dynamics, and mass-market loading techniques, among many others, must be fleshed out before this product can reach the market. For example, loading techniques such as pre-filled &quot;wheels&quot; that could be loaded like a cartridge by a pharmacist must be explored if this is to be used in any sort of mass-market setting. Ownership dynamics must also be explored: is this a device that a patient would rent from a hospital, pharmacy, or buy outright? Would this be paid for by insurance, and what motives are there for insurers to pay for such a device? Other not-so-obvious things such as how the device would be cleaned between different patients must also be explored, along with managing critical reception from medical professionals and administrative bodies such as the FDA– especially since this device is built to work with controlled substances.<br><br>As this is a proof-of-concept and not yet a production-ready, FDA-approved device, some of these limitations are understandable. However, this project is valuable more broadly in exploring and attempting to address these issues around outpatient opioid use (and the root causes of abuse), education, and dispensing practices. <br></div>
