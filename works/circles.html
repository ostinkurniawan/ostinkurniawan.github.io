        <h3 class="project-content-section">The Problem</h3>
        <p class="project-content-text">There is a lack of <strong>communication between the RSOs (Registered Student Organisations) on the UW campus and the students</strong>. Due to the sheer number of RSOs available and <strong>existing information fragmented</strong> across multiple services, interested students find it <strong>difficult to find RSOs or events</strong> that pertain to their interests. For similar reasons, RSOs also find it difficult to conduct effective outreach for their events and communities.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <h3 class="project-content-section">User Research and Design Requirements</h3>
    <p class="project-content-text">We conducted six semi-structured user interviews with members of both the RSO audience and the RSO leaders themselves. We identified the pain points that these two groups had experienced and came up with a number of design requirements: <br><br>1. Being able to narrow down RSOs and RSO events with <strong>filters</strong><br>2. The ability to <strong>RSVP</strong> to an event<br>3. The ability for users to <strong>receive notifications/reminders</strong> about selected events<br>4. Allow users to see what Events and RSOs are currently <strong>Trending</strong>​<br>5. Ability to <strong>sync</strong> to other calendars ​<br>6. A <strong>calendar</strong> for users to visualize upcoming events</p>
    <h2 class="project-content-section">Ideation and Sketching</h2>
    <p class="project-content-text">We explored different screen styles, different delivery methods (desktop access vs. mobile access), and different information priorities. We chose to use a <strong>mobile app</strong> that used <strong>Facebook</strong> logins with <strong>connected UW IDs</strong> to <strong>facilitate the connection</strong> rather than creating an entirely new &quot;social network&quot; that would just increase service fragmentation. Below are my sketches of potential solutions, in both web and mobile formats. We decided to go with a <strong>mobile application</strong> because it would be the <strong>primary device when on-the-go and going to events</strong>.</p><img src="../images/sketches.jpg" srcset="../images/sketches-p-500.jpeg 500w, ../images/sketches-p-800.jpeg 800w, ../images/sketches-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, ../images/sketches-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, ../images/sketches-p-2000.jpeg 2000w, ../images/sketches-p-2600.jpeg 2600w, ../images/sketches.jpg 2606w" sizes="100vw">
    <h2 class="project-content-section">Storyboarding</h2>
    <p class="project-content-text">Our storyboards helped <strong>demonstrate the real world implications</strong> of our application and <strong>gave context</strong> to the different scenarios we developed in previous steps. In addition, it was useful because it enabled us to <strong>consider how users will navigate</strong> throughout the application and what actions will come from a specific interaction. In doing so, our storyboard supplemented our created information architectures and final artefacts. Below is one of the storyboards I designed! (excuse my drawing skills)</p><img src="../images/storyboards.jpg" srcset="../images/storyboards-p-500.jpeg 500w, ../images/storyboards-p-800.jpeg 800w, ../images/storyboards.jpg 1300w" sizes="100vw">
    <h2 class="project-content-section">Information Archtecture</h2>
    <p class="project-content-text">We developed the information architecture – the structure of this information resource – to ensure that our application was laid out <strong>logically</strong> and provided <strong>alternate decision paths</strong>. We decided to have seven core pages: <br><br>- Home Page<br>- Individual RSO Page<br>- Individual Event Page<br>- Discover page<br>- Search page<br>- My RSOs page<br>- Settings page<br><br>The flow diagram shown below outlines both the information architecture and primary user flows.</p><img src="../images/interactionflow.jpg" srcset="../images/interactionflow-p-500.jpeg 500w, ../images/interactionflow-p-800.jpeg 800w, ../images/interactionflow-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, ../images/interactionflow.jpg 1500w" sizes="100vw">
    <h2 class="project-content-section">Paper Prototype &amp; Usability Testing</h2>
    <p class="project-content-text">We developed a basic paper prototype based on our information architecture and <strong>conducted informal user testing with low-fidelity prototype</strong>. We created three tasks for users to complete, and asked them to voice their thought process as they completed the task with the paper prototypes. We then iterated on our prototype based on the feedback we received and the pain points and confusion identified. Below is a rough overview of some of the screens we outlined.</p><img src="../images/paperprototype.jpg" srcset="../images/paperprototype-p-500.jpeg 500w, ../images/paperprototype-p-800.jpeg 800w, ../images/paperprototype-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, ../images/paperprototype.jpg 1500w" sizes="100vw" class="image-8">
    <p class="project-content-text">The three tasks we asked our testers to complete were: <br>1. Finding the Location of an Event<br>2. Subscribing to RSO Notifications and Updates through an Event<br>3. Editing the Description of a Specific RSO Page<br><br>We outlined these tasks in a number of user task flows, shown below. For a more in-depth look into these user flows (with some alternate and error states), <a href="../documents/circles.pdf" class="link-solid-fade">click here</a>.</p><a href="../documents/circles.pdf" target="_blank" class="w-inline-block"><img src="../images/userflow.jpg" width="1577.5" srcset="../images/userflow-p-500.jpeg 500w, ../images/userflow-p-800.jpeg 800w, ../images/userflow-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, ../images/userflow-p-1600.jpeg 1600w, ../images/userflow-p-2000.jpeg 2000w, ../images/userflow-p-2600.jpeg 2600w, ../images/userflow.jpg 2896w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 80vw, 54vw"></a>
    <h2 class="project-content-section">Usability Testing Findings</h2>
    <p class="project-content-text">We reached out to the people who we did our initial user research on in order to get the most relevant feedback. By conducting these usability tests, we were able to identify strengths and pain points throughout our proposed application. We identified a number of improvements, the most notable being:</p>
    <h4 class="project-content-section-subheading">1: Inconsistent references to “My RSOs” vs “My Circles”</h4>
    <p class="project-content-text">In the “Individual RSO” pages, users clicked the “+Add to Circles” button but were confused to where that RSO would be added to within the application. While this button would add the RSO to their “My RSOs” page, users found this unintuitive, citing that “If it’s adding to “My Circles” there should be a “My Circles” page instead of a “My RSOs” page”. To mitigate this, we plan to change the “My RSOs” button in the Navigation bar to a “My Circles” button, and change the iconography from a simplistic drawing of a group of humans to a set of circles.</p>
    <h4 class="project-content-section-subheading">2. Alternate approach to “Changing Interests”</h4>
    <p class="project-content-text">When asked to “Edit their interests”, one participant immediately went to the Search page instead of the Settings page to change their interests. When asked why they checked the Search page first, the participant said that “I thought it would be a filter setting in the Search page”. From this, an alternate pathway to get to the “Edit your interests” settings page could be inserted within the Search page to facilitate a more intuitive interaction.
    </p>
    <h4 class="project-content-section-subheading">3. Maps Page</h4>
    <p class="project-content-text">When asked to find the location of an event from the home screen, all participants were able to navigate through the UI quickly and accurately. However, one participant pointed out that on the Maps screen, that while they were able to get the map location of the building, they were unable to see any specific details about that location on the map without having to go back to the previous page and flip back and forth between the Event page and the Map.</p>
    <h2 class="project-content-section">Wireframes</h2>
    <p class="project-content-text">Wireframes of the whole app, designed on top of our research, testing, and initial paper prototype, were created to allow for more interactive user testing. These would function as a basis for continued iterative design as we identified pain points in onboarding, key user task flows, discoverability, and so on.</p><img src="../images/wireframes.png" srcset="../images/wireframes-p-500.png 500w, ../images/wireframes-p-800.png 800w, ../images/wireframes-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/wireframes.png 1500w" sizes="100vw"><img src="../images/interaction.jpg" srcset="../images/interaction-p-500.jpeg 500w, ../images/interaction-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, ../images/interaction.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw">
    <h2 class="project-content-section">Interactive Wireframes for User Testing</h2>
    <p class="project-content-text">An interactive wireframe was developed to identify <strong>pain points in key user task flows</strong> and iron them out. An example of an initial stage for our interactive wireframe is displayed below (it&#x27;s functional!).</p>
    <div class="adobe-xd-embed w-embed w-iframe"><iframe width="377" height="667" src="https://xd.adobe.com/embed/d38fc52f-dffd-44a5-8cfe-f43631f0c554/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
    <p class="project-content-text">What we found was that alternate pathways to the same result (e.g. how to get to an event page) were required (a result of an alternate mental model). We also received feedback on actionable states and unintuitive design in terms of iconography and their implied meaning.</p>
    <h2 class="project-content-section">Final Mocks</h2>
    <p class="project-content-text">Using the iterative feedback gained from our interactive user testing, mocks of several key pages were developed. We found the biggest hurdles for our user task flows to be the specific language that was used when labelling things such as buttons as well as status feedback symbols, like the &quot;checkmark&quot; used to indicate that a user is going to event needed to be double encoded (colour &amp; symbols).</p><img src="../images/screens_line.png" srcset="../images/screens_line-p-500.png 500w, ../images/screens_line-p-800.png 800w, ../images/screens_line-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/screens_line.png 1686w" sizes="100vw">
    <h2 class="project-content-section">What would I do differently next time?</h2>
    <h3 class="project-content-section-subheading">Fix Exclusionary Facebook Integration</h3>
    <p class="project-content-text">We chose to use Facebook + UW NetID as our primary way of logging in into the application. This was done to prevent the app from becoming &quot;yet another&quot; social media app– we wanted it to do what it needed to do, and nothing more. However, requiring Facebook as the social &quot;backbone&quot; does exclude people who choose not to use Facebook. In doing so, this application fails to address the needs of those users. To rectify this, a Facebook-supplemented &quot;friends&quot; functionality could be integrated where users could add other users as &quot;friends&quot; (Facebook friends would be automatically added) so they can enjoy the social functionality as well.</p>
    <h3 class="project-content-section-subheading">Increase the scope of the application</h3>
    <p class="project-content-text">While we have specifically designed this application around the UW student experience, I can see this being used in other universities and high schools around the country. Increasing the scope of this application to allow it to be used in different environment would both challenge us and increase the app&#x27;s viability as a business.</p>
