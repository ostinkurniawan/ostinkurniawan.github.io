    <h4 class="heading"><strong class="section-header">INTRODUCTION</strong></h4>
    <div class="project-text">As a side project to put my HCDE theory and interaction design skills to the test, I challenged myself to do a (unsolicited) redesign for a feature of an app I used regularly in a single weekend. I chose Venmo since it has largely become an essential tool in the average college students’ arsenal of smartphone apps, seeing regular use for all sorts of financial transactions — from splitting rent to meals alike. The feature I saw the most potential for a redesign was the integrated Search and Pay function. There are a couple reasons as to why.</div>
    <div class="image-block"><img src="images/vm_initial.jpg" srcset="images/vm_initial-p-800.jpeg 800w, images/vm_initial-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, images/vm_initial.jpg 1332w" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="inline-image">
      <p class="img-caption">The Venmo app, as of January 2018. Note the small &quot;QR&quot; icon near the user image in the left screenshot, and the fact that my Facebook friend &quot;Casey&quot; does not show up immediately as a search result.</p>
    </div>
    <h4 class="section-header">Venmo effectively has two types of ‘Friends’ — Venmo Friends and Facebook Friends. This distinction is not immediately clear.</h4>
    <ul class="project-content-list">
      <li>
        <div class="list-item">Facebook friends are not automatically added as Venmo Friends, even though the account is linked.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="list-item">Facebook friends are not prioritised over other accounts that may match a Search query.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="list-item">A common issue I hear from other users is that users have to unnecessarily search through the search results because their Facebook friends are not at the top.Users you have interacted with in the past are not prioritised either.</div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="section-header">While the act of scanning Venmo Codes is immediately accessible and easy to use, finding the Venmo code to share is not very intuitive or quick.</h4>
    <ul class="project-content-list">

        <div class="list-item">Finding a Venmo code requires the user to dive into many menus.</div>

    </div>
    <h4 class="heading"><strong class="section-header"><br>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</strong></h4>
    <div class="project-text">I researched other “peer payment” apps like Cash App (previously Square Cash), Messenger Pay, Apple Pay Cash, and Google Wallet. I studied their search functions, especially in relation to the process of group payments. I also studied the search functions of other social apps like Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram to identify best practices in ensuring that what is searched for is most relevant to the user. In doing so, I came up with a number of key insights:</div>
    <ul class="project-content-list">
      <li>
        <div class="list-item">In Instagram and Snapchat, the service provides a number of <strong>‘Suggested’ users</strong> to interact with, presumably based on most recently or most interacted with. It <strong>then breaks down search into ‘Recent’ or ‘Top’</strong>, which sort by immediate friends or people you’ve interacted with based on those criterion. <strong>People you have never interacted with are at the bottom of the list, and out of sight unless you specifically scroll down far enough.</strong></div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="list-item">Snapchat and Messenger provide <strong>one-click or one-swipe access to their respective visual user ‘Codes’</strong> (Snapcodes and Messenger Codes), making it easy for users to share their codes without having to dig through a multiple layers of menus.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="list-item">Snapchat provides <strong>quick access to users you’ve recently interacted with</strong> when sending Snaps, which makes sending people regular payments easy and visual, rather than scrolling through a list.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="list-item">When requesting money from multiple people, Google Wallet <strong>presents the users you are requesting/paying money to in a list</strong>, which makes it easier to check whether you’ve charged the correct amount of people.</div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="heading"><strong class="section-header"><br>USER RESEARCH</strong></h4>
    <div class="project-text">I conducted informal user observations to identify the pain points during this process. I asked four of my friends (three college students, one high schooler) to request a sample payment from a group of five of my other friends, while I watched them use the application. I asked them to think aloud, and especially voice any concerns when the application became confusing. In doing so, I found and/or confirmed a number of issues:</div>
    <h4 class="section-header">Facebook friends not prioritised</h4>
    <div class="project-text">All participants had difficulty finding the target recipient. All were Facebook friends with the recipient, but the target recipient was never the first result, rather it was usually the fourth or fifth result, preceded by other people they did not know. They only identified the target recipient by the profile picture.</div>
    <h4 class="section-header">Pay when they mean to request, and vice versa</h4>
    <div class="project-text">At the end of the transaction sequence, three of the four participants hovered over &#x27;request&#x27; button before they pressed the &#x27;pay&#x27; button, i.e. they almost paid the transaction targets when they meant to request money from them.</div>
    <h4 class="section-header">Difficulty finding the Venmo QR code</h4>
    <div class="project-text">When asked to find the Venmo QR code, three of the four participants replied &quot;there&#x27;s a Venmo code?&quot;. These three were then asked to look for the code and show it to me. All three opened the hamburger menu and tapped their profile picture (they missed the small QR icon), then tapped the small QR icon beside their profile picture. When asked why they tapped on the second one rather than the first instance of the QR code, answers included &quot;because it was still there, there was no other option&quot; and &quot;I didn&#x27;t know the button was so small&quot;.</div>
    <h4 class="heading"><strong class="section-header"><br>SKETCHING</strong></h4>
    <div class="project-text">With the user research and my insights in mind, I started to sketch out requirements and ideas for enhancing the search function in Venmo. These rough sketches gave me insight into the moving components, the touch targets, and informational architecture of the the application.</div>
    <div class="image-block"><img src="images/vm-sketches.jpeg" srcset="images/vm-sketches-p-500.jpeg 500w, images/vm-sketches-p-800.jpeg 800w, images/vm-sketches-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, images/vm-sketches.jpeg 1298w" sizes="100vw" alt="" class="inline-image">
      <p class="img-caption">A sample of my ideation sketches!</p>
    </div>
    <h4 class="heading"><strong class="section-header"><br>PROTOYPING</strong></h4>
    <div class="project-text">Since I would be iterating on the existing Venmo interface rather than completely redesigning it, I decided that jumping straight into high-fidelity prototyping would save me time. Framer allows for quick and live iterations, and so I could test these live, especially with the Framer Preview app, which allows me to send the prototypes to a phone for live testing. I started the redesign process by re-creating screenshots of the Venmo Android app. My goal is to redesign the Search interaction and not the entire app, and so copying the original Android app gave me insight into both Venmo’s design language and the Material Design specification used. Once three basic screens were copied (Venmo home screen, Pay/Request opening screen, and Pay/Request search results), I iterated on these until solutions were achieved.I focused on solving only one user flow: requesting/paying people that are not your Venmo friends. There are three types of screens in the Payment/Request sequence (referenced as “P/R sequence” hereafter):</div>
    <ul class="project-content-list">
      <li>
        <div class="list-item">The “Add” screen, which is the default state when no search query is inputted. Here, “Top People” can be added quickly to the list of P/R receipients.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="list-item">The “Search” screen, which shows the search result for a given query.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="list-item">The “Finishing” screen, which is shown after all recipients have been added. This screen has input fields for the “payment memo” and the payment details.</div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="project-text">The changes I made and the rationales behind them will be explained screen-by-screen.</div>
    <h4 class="section-header">Recent Users</h4>
    <div class="sidebyside-captionwithimage">
      <div class="div-block-2">
        <div class="project-text"><strong>Problem:</strong> Users do not have access to a list of people they have recently interacted with.</div>
        <div class="project-text"><strong>Solution:</strong> Split the users listed in the “Add” Screen into “Recommended” and “Recent” instead of just “Top People”.</div>

    <div class="sidebyside-captionwithimage">
      <div class="div-block-2">
        <div class="project-text"><strong>Problem:</strong> Search results are only prioritised by Venmo friends and Venmo mutual friends. If Facebook friends are not a user’s Venmo friend too, they have the same low priority as random people.</div>
        <div class="project-text"><strong>Solution:</strong> Group search results by “Suggested” and “Other People on Venmo”.  “Other People on Venmo” will have a secondary hierarchy, showing people you have the most mutual friends in descending order. If you have recently had an interaction with a user, a “Recent” tag will also show up.</div>
      </div>

    <h4 class="heading"><strong class="section-header"><br>USER TESTING</strong></h4>
    <div class="project-text">I conducted a second round of user testing with my original testing participants, and received feedback. While most of the feedback was positive, there are a couple of things they found unintuitive:</div>
    <h4 class="section-header">Adding a user to the recipient list is jarring</h4>
    <div class="project-text">One participant found that the lack of animation when adding a person to the list of participants was jarring and unituitive. This could be resolved by adding a quick animation showing a user &quot;card&quot; sliding right of the search results then sliding into the recipient list from the left, or moving straight up from the search results to the recipient list.</div>
    <h4 class="section-header">Transaction amount selection too close to confirmation button</h4>
    <div class="project-text">While the transaction amount was clearer and accidental false payments were mitigated, two users felt that the payment &quot;tab&quot; was too close to the &quot;confirm payment&quot; button, leading to a higher likeliness of sending a payment/request with a wrong amount.</div>
    <h4 class="heading"><strong class="section-header"><br>REFLECTION</strong></h4>
    <div class="project-text">Over this process, I have learned a ton about the micro-interactions that make interactions more intuitive, less painful, and more efficient. This project has allowed me to also become much more familiar with the Material Design spec, making me more confident that I can use it effectively and efficiently. In addition to the suggestions made in round 2 of the user testing, some things I’d like to improve on are in-screen animations that use movement, especially within the Material Design spec, to make the interactions clearer and even more intuitive. Overall, I’ve had a ton of fun doing this redesign and it has only solidified my love for the process.</div>
